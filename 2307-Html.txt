HTML Document and Tags
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Every html doc must be created using following content:

<!doctype html>  <------ Ensure that web-browser starts in "standard
			 mode".


<html lang="en">  <----- Always specify the "document language"
  <head>
     <title>Title of document</title> <----- Never ignore this element
     .......
  </head>
  <body>
     .....
  </body>
</html>


<!DOCTYPE html>
--------------------
You can use lowercase letters to add <!doctype> processing instruction. This <!doctype> is an instruction for a web-browser to select appropriate version of "HTML Parser". There are different versions of "HTML-parsers" a web-browser have.

Each HTML parser parse the document and produce DOM-Tree (Document Object Model) or HTML Objects in order to render them with the help of "Graphics Engine (e.g. web-kit engine of google chrome)". Later these DOMs (Html Objects) are used by JavaScript language.

When <!doctype> is included in document then web-browser automatically select the latest stable version of HTML parser to parse the elements.

And if <!doctype> is not included then web-browser is free to choose any version of HTML parser and hence resulting in-compatible DOMs.

In fact, web-browser always start with one or the two modes : 1) standard mode (when <!doctype> is included) and 2) Quirk mode (dirty mode. When <!doctype> is not included).

In quirk mode, output will always surprise you. (Unexpected output).

[NOTE: Browsers in devices (mobile) cannot start when <!doctype> is not included]


 <html lang="en">
-------------------------------
 Crawler (Search engine) will classify your document on "language"  you've choosen.

<head>
--------------------------------
 <head> represents title of document which will displayed on client's           window.
  
        It has one or more <meta/> elements for search engine (crawler)
	including -- author, about page content, character-set, 	keywords, robot, index and so on.

        We can add <script>, <style>, <link> inside the <head> however <script> and <link> should be added at the end of document (before </body> close tag) to ensure the HTML ELEMENTS are not blocked by Script or CSS content.

<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">
   <head> <title></title></head>
   <body>
     .....
     .....
     <script src="sample.js"></script>
     <script src="jquery.js"></script>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="sample.css"/>
   </body>
</html>
<!--- You can add script code outside the </html> (as google coding standard ) --->
<script>
 //code
</script>
